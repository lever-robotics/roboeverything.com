This is a Docusaurus project hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Downloading the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:

   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Adding Content

1. **Navigate to the `docs` directory**:
   ```bash
   cd docs
   ```

2. **Add new markdown files**:
   - Create a new markdown file for your content.
   - Update the sidebar configuration in `sidebars.js` to include your new file.

3. **Edit existing content**:
   - Make your changes directly in the markdown files.

4. **Preview changes locally**:

   npm start
   ```
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see your changes.

## Deploying a New Version

1. **Ensure the `GIT_USER` environment variable is set**:

   ```

2. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use SSH for deployment by modifying the deploy script in `package.json`:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "deploy": "USE_SSH=true docusaurus deploy"
   }
   ```

4. **Verify deployment**:
   - Your site should be accessible at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name/`.
