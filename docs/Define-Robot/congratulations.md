# Congratulations!

You have learned the basics of URDF creation and how to use the URDF Creator application to design a robot in ROS2.

As a review in this section you learned:

- Why URDF is important in the context of robotic development and ROS2.
- What is the URDF and its basic elements.
- What are all the parameters that can be set for links
- What are all the parameters that can be set for joints
- Understanding the code of a URDF file
- How to deploy a URDF file to a ROS2 package


Next we will go into best practices for modeling different types of robots.
