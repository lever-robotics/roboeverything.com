# Quick Start - Building a ROS2 Robot 

Welcome to the Quick Start Guide for URDF Creator! This documentation provides a concise overview of the URDF Creator tool, enabling users to efficiently design and deploy robots in ROS2. 

***We advise that all users of URDF Creator both students and experienced robot developers to go through this quick start guide before looking at the detailed documentation.***

## Introduction

The URDF Creator is a powerful tool tailored for ROS2 users, facilitating the creation of robot models within the ROS ecosystem. The URDF is a Unified Robot Description Format that defines the geometry, kinematics, joint connections, sensor specifications, aswell as transformations between frames provided by robot state publisher.

## Understanding URDF

Before diving into the tool itself, let's briefly discuss the Uniform Robotics Description Format (URDF). URDF serves as a standardized XML-based format for describing robots in ROS. It encompasses various elements such as links, joints, sensors, and visuals, all crucial for accurately representing a robot's physical structure and kinematics.

### Links and Joints

Links represent physical components of the robot, such as wheels, arms, or sensors. Joints define the connections between these links, enabling movement and articulation.

### tf2 Library and Frames of Reference

In ROS2, the tf2 library manages coordinate frame transformations, crucial for understanding the spatial relationships between different components of the robot. Each link and joint in the URDF corresponds to a frame of reference, allowing seamless integration with ROS2's tf2 framework.

## Exporting a URDF

Once you've designed your robot model using the URDF Creator, the next step is to export it for integration into the ROS2 ecosystem. The exported URDF file serves as the blueprint for your robot's virtual representation within ROS, enabling simulation, visualization, and control.

### Exporting Process

We'll walk you through the simple process of exporting your URDF file from the URDF Creator, ensuring compatibility and seamless integration with other ROS2 tools and packages.

Throughout this guide, we'll utilize images produced by the ROS2 community to enhance understanding and visualization. We extend our gratitude to the ROS2 community for their invaluable contributions to robotics and open-source software.

Let's embark on the journey of designing and deploying ROS2 robots with the URDF Creator!
