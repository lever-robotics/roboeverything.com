Josh Newman does a great job explaining transformations in ROS2. You can find the rest of his tutorials here: [Josh Newman's ROS2 Tutorials](https://articulatedrobotics.xyz/tutorials/ready-for-ros/tf)

## Introduction

Transformations are a key concept in robotics. They are used to describe the position and orientation of objects in a 3D space. In ROS2, transformations are managed by the `tf2` library. This library provides a way to represent and manipulate transformations in a way that is easy to work with.
