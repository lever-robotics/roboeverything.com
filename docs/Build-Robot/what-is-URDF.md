# What is the URDF?

This module covers what is the URDF (Uniform Robotics Description Format) and why it is important in the context of robotic development and ROS2.

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is a file format for specifying the geometry and organization of robots in ROS



URDF's are made up of 2 basic elements Links and Joints. Links are the elements that define the shape and size of the robot. They are the building blocks of the robot and are connected by joints. Joints are the elements that connect two links in a robot. They define the relative motion between the links.
