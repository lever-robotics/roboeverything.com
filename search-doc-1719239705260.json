Some of the key features of the URDF Creator include:  Menu (Top Left): Access to the export URDF option as well as future development into project management.Project Name (Top Left): Name of the robot, will be used as the name of exported packages. Default: robotTools (Top Middle): Tools for moving, rotating, and resizing links.Object Tree (Left): Displays the hierarchy of links in the robot model. Joint information is carried inside each link but the base_link defining its relationship to its parent.Add Objects (Bottom Left): Buttons to add shapes to the scene.View (Center): Main view which can be viewed from different angles, and links can be selected and manipulated.Object Parameters (Top Right): Once a link is selected, information about the selected link. The following parameters can be altered: Link Name: Name of the link also used as the frame_id in the URDF.Color: Color of the link.Weight: Weight of the link.Joints: Joints that are connected to the link.Position: Position of the link.Rotation: Rotation of the link.Scale: Scale of the link.Sensor: Sensor information of the link.
